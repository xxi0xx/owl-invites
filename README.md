# 🎉 OpenRSVP

A self-hosted, privacy-first alternative to Evite. Create beautiful event invitations, manage RSVPs, and communicate with guests — all without ads or data tracking. Perfect for birthday parties, gatherings, and celebrations.

> [!WARNING]
> **Owl Invites is in staged redevelopment. Gate 2 is a development milestone,
> not a production release.** Gate 2 replaces the legacy attendee/RSVP-token
> model with isolated invitation households and removes the legacy mutation
> code and schema. No Owl Invites production
> container image has been published; do not deploy an upstream OpenRSVP image
> or an unpinned `:latest` tag as a substitute for this branch.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Passwordless Auth** — Magic link sign-in, no passwords to manage
- 🏠 **Private Invitation Households** — Every invitation is an isolated capability and response boundary; matching names or contact details never merge households
- 👥 **Per-Person Responses** — Assigned and allowed additional guests respond independently without creating organizer accounts
- 🌐 **Open Enrollment** — Optional, time-windowed enrollment capabilities create new isolated households with atomic capacity enforcement
- ❓ **Scoped Questions** — Invitation- and guest-level questions and answers use explicit ownership
- 📬 **Email Delivery** — Private invitations, recovery links, reminders, cancellation notices, and one-way organizer broadcasts use stored invitation destinations
- ⏰ **Scheduled Reminders** — Automatic event reminders target invitation households by response group
- 🔗 **Webhooks** — Event lifecycle callbacks with HMAC signing
- 📊 **Email Tracking** — Delivery status, open tracking, and per-event email statistics; provider bounce/complaint parsers remain dormant pending authenticated inbound webhook support
- ✉️ **Unsubscribe & Suppression** — One-click unsubscribe footer on reminder/message emails, with a suppression list that skips opted-out addresses
- 🧭 **Secure Setup Wizard** — One-time, environment-token-authorized creation of the first administrator and instance settings
- 📦 **Data Export & Account Deletion** — Organizers can export all their data and permanently delete their account from an Account settings page
- 🛡️ **Privacy by Design** — Data auto-deletes after a configurable retention period (default 30 days post-event)
- 🤖 **Bot Protection** — Honeypot fields and IP-based rate limiting
- 📈 **Instance Admin** — User invitations, role/status controls, aggregate statistics, and a focused audit trail for sensitive changes
- 🏠 **Self-Hosted** — Single Docker container, you own your data
- 🗄️ **SQLite or PostgreSQL** — SQLite by default; PostgreSQL is fully supported and CI-tested. The full test suite runs against both

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Gate 2 local container build

Run this from a checkout of `codex/gate-2-invitation-domain`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set OWL_INVITES_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN in .env to a long random secret.
docker compose up -d --build
```

Visit http://localhost:8091, enter the same bootstrap token in the first-run
wizard, and create the first administrator. After setup succeeds, remove the
token from the container environment; the backend permanently closes the
bootstrap endpoint either way.

The local Compose stack builds the checked-out source and includes Mailpit;
captured development email is available at http://localhost:8025. This is a
development/review configuration, not production deployment guidance.

### With PostgreSQL

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+ (the `toolchain go1.26.3` directive auto-fetches the patched compiler when `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, the default)
- Node.js 22+
- Make

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download
cd web && npm install && cd ..

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env

# Start the Go backend
make dev

# In another terminal, start the Svelte dev server
cd web && npm run dev
```

The Svelte dev server at http://localhost:5173 proxies API requests to the Go backend at http://localhost:8080.

### Build

```bash
# Build everything (frontend + backend)
make build

# Outputs: bin/openrsvp and bin/owl-invites
```

The generated Gate 2 API client is checked during `npm run check`. Browser
acceptance tests expect a running application and Mailpit:

```bash
cd web
npm run test:e2e
```

### 🗄️ Database & Migrations

The full test suite runs against both SQLite and PostgreSQL in CI. Migrations live in per-dialect directories, `internal/database/migrations/sqlite` and `internal/database/migrations/postgres`, because some schema changes (for example CHECK-constraint edits) differ between the two engines. When you add a migration, add it to both directories.

See [Gate 2 invitation domain](docs/gate-2-invitation-domain.md) for the
authoritative domain, capability lifecycle, migration mapping, feature
disposition, authorization matrix, and known limitations. Gate 1 background
remains in [Gate 1 foundation](docs/gate-1-foundation.md).

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all options.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Server port |
| `ENV` | `development` | Environment (`development` or `production`) |
| `DB_DRIVER` | `sqlite` | Database driver (`sqlite` or `postgres`) |
| `DB_DSN` | `/data/openrsvp.db` | Database connection string |
| `UPLOADS_DIR` | `/data/uploads` | Directory for uploaded files |
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Public URL for magic links and invites |
| `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `smtp` | Email provider (`smtp`, `sendgrid`, `ses`) |
| `DEFAULT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Days after event to auto-delete data |
| `FEEDBACK_GITHUB_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | GitHub PAT for posting feedback as Issues |
| `FEEDBACK_GITHUB_REPO` | _(empty)_ | Target repo for Issues, e.g. `owner/repo` |
| `FEEDBACK_EMAIL` | _(empty)_ | Email address to receive feedback (fallback) |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated CIDR ranges of trusted reverse proxies (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12`). When set, `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` headers are trusted to determine client IP. When empty (default), only `RemoteAddr` is used, which prevents IP spoofing. **Set this when running behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.)** |
| `MAX_COHOSTS_PER_EVENT` | `10` | Maximum number of co-hosts allowed per event |
| `ALLOW_SIGNUPS` | `false` | Allows unsolicited organizer account creation. Admin invitations, co-host invitations, and acceptance of issued invitations remain available when this is off |
| `OWL_INVITES_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | One-time, environment-only authorization for creating the first persistent administrator. Required for fresh Internet-reachable installations; never stored in the database |
| `OWL_INVITES_ACCOUNT_INVITE_EXPIRY` | `72h` | Lifetime of administrator-issued account invitation capabilities |
| `OWL_INVITES_SECRET_KEY` | _(required)_ | Stable HMAC key of at least 32 bytes for invitation and open-enrollment capabilities. **Critical restore material:** back it up with the database; loss or global rotation invalidates all capability links |
| `OWL_INVITES_INVITATION_SESSION_EXPIRY` | `720h` | Lifetime of a random, hashed-at-rest browser invitation session |
| `OWL_INVITES_INVITATION_RECOVERY_EXPIRY` | `15m` | Lifetime of a one-time, hashed-at-rest invitation recovery capability |

`OWL_INVITES_SECRET_KEY` is distinct from per-invitation `token_version`
rotation. Incrementing one invitation's version revokes only that invitation's
links and sessions. Replacing the global key invalidates every private and open
capability and should be treated as an operator-controlled recovery event.

### 📧 Email Providers

**SMTP** (default):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port (default: `587`) |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | Sender email address |

### Host-side administrator recovery

After first-run setup is committed, the bootstrap endpoint stays closed. If
all administrators become unavailable, run the Owl Invites CLI on a trusted
host with the same database configuration:

```bash
go run ./cmd/owl-invites admin promote --email operator@example.com
```

The release container also includes the CLI:

```bash
docker compose exec openrsvp owl-invites admin promote --email operator@example.com
```

The user must already exist. The command activates and promotes that identity
and records an `emergency_role_recovery` entry with a CLI actor in the minimal
admin audit trail. It does not read or reuse `OWL_INVITES_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`.

**SendGrid** (`NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | SendGrid API key (`SG.xxxxx`) |
| `SENDGRID_FROM` | Sender email address |

**AWS SES** (`NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SES_REGION` | AWS region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `SES_USERNAME` | SES SMTP username |
| `SES_PASSWORD` | SES SMTP password |
| `SES_FROM` | Sender email address |

### 📱 SMS Providers (Optional)

Set `NOTIFICATION_SMS_PROVIDER` to enable SMS notifications for reminders.

**Twilio** (`NOTIFICATION_SMS_PROVIDER=twilio`):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio Account SID (`ACxxxxx`) |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Twilio Auth Token |
| `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | Twilio sender phone number (`+15551234567`) |

**Vonage** (`NOTIFICATION_SMS_PROVIDER=vonage`):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VONAGE_API_KEY` | Vonage API key |
| `VONAGE_API_SECRET` | Vonage API secret |
| `VONAGE_FROM` | Sender name or number |

**Amazon SNS** (`NOTIFICATION_SMS_PROVIDER=sns`):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SNS_SMS_REGION` | AWS region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `SNS_SMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key ID |
| `SNS_SMS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret access key |

## 📡 API

All API endpoints are under `/api/v1`. The server also provides:

Open tracking is gated by `EMAIL_OPEN_TRACKING_ENABLED`. SendGrid/SES inbound
parser and support code remains in the repository, but its unsigned provider
routes are not mounted or exposed. Bounce/complaint ingestion through those
providers is unavailable until authenticated webhook support is implemented
(see [Known limitations](#known-limitations)).

### ✉️ Unsubscribe

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/unsubscribe?token=…` | Resolve an unsubscribe token (public) |

## 🏠 Self-Hosting Guide

### 🐳 Docker

> [!CAUTION]
> Gate 2 has no published Owl Invites production image and is not approved for
> production deployment. The example below builds a review image from the
> current checkout; it does not pull an image from GHCR.

Build a local, explicitly named image from this branch:

```bash
docker build --tag owl-invites:gate-2-review .
```

For an isolated review deployment, use that exact local tag:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  openrsvp:
    image: owl-invites:gate-2-review
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - 8080
    environment:
      ENV: production
      BASE_URL: https://rsvp.yourdomain.com
      OWL_INVITES_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN: replace-with-a-long-random-secret
      DB_DSN: /data/openrsvp.db
      UPLOADS_DIR: /data/uploads
      SMTP_HOST: smtp.yourdomain.com
      SMTP_PORT: 587
      SMTP_USERNAME: noreply@yourdomain.com
      SMTP_PASSWORD: yourpassword
      SMTP_FROM: noreply@yourdomain.com
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Required variables for production:**

| Variable | Why it's required |
|----------|-------------------|
| `ENV=production` | Switches to JSON structured logging |
| `BASE_URL` | Used in magic links and invite emails — must be the public HTTPS URL |
| `SMTP_*` | Email delivery is required for magic link login |

> **Data persistence:** all state lives under `/data` (SQLite DB + uploads), while `OWL_INVITES_SECRET_KEY` is required restore material. Back up both; losing the key invalidates every private and open capability after a database restore.

### Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name rsvp.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### 💬 Feedback

The in-app feedback button requires at least one delivery channel. **If neither is configured, submissions return 200 OK but are silently discarded** — a warning is logged at startup.

**Option 1 — GitHub Issues (recommended)**

Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope (classic) or Issues write permission (fine-grained):

```
FEEDBACK_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
FEEDBACK_GITHUB_REPO=yourorg/yourrepo
```

Each submission opens an Issue titled `[Feedback - bug] …` with labels `feedback` and the feedback type.

**Option 2 — Email fallback**

Requires `SMTP_*` (or another email provider) to be configured:

```
FEEDBACK_EMAIL=feedback@yourdomain.com
```

GitHub Issues takes priority if both are set. Email is used as fallback when only `FEEDBACK_EMAIL` is provided.

### 💾 Backups

Migration 36 is a one-way Gate 2 cutover. Before upgrading, create and verify a
database backup and retain the matching `OWL_INVITES_SECRET_KEY` material. The
migrator intentionally refuses every target below version 36 once the cutover
has run; it will not recreate empty legacy tables and pretend deleted RSVP,
comment, or message data was restored. If rollback is required, stop the Gate 2
application and restore the complete pre-upgrade backup, then run the
pre-Gate-2 application against that restored state.

For SQLite, back up the database file:
```bash
sqlite3 /data/openrsvp.db ".backup /backups/openrsvp-$(date +%Y%m%d).db"
```

For PostgreSQL, use `pg_dump`:
```bash
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U openrsvp openrsvp > backup.sql
```

### ⚠️ Known limitations

- Gate 2 is not a production release. Migration 36 removes legacy attendee,
  RSVP-token, comments, and two-way message tables after migration 34 maps
  recoverable response data. The cutover is irreversible in-place: take and
  verify a backup before testing upgrades, and restore that backup for rollback.
- Private invitation capabilities are durable by design: replay creates a new
  time-limited session for the same household until the organizer rotates or
  revokes the invitation. They do not carry an independent expiry timestamp.
- SMS providers remain in the inherited notification subsystem, but Gate 2
  invitation delivery and recovery are email-only.
- Legacy CSV attendee import/export, guestbook/comments, waitlist behavior, and
  guest-to-organizer message threads are disabled and have no mounted API.
- Invite-card customization remains an organizer tool but is not yet included
  in the Gate 2 guest household payload; guest presentation integration is
  deferred rather than exposed through a legacy public share token.
- Webhook delivery in Gate 2 supports `event.published` and `event.cancelled`.
  Stored subscriptions for retired RSVP/comment event names are inert and are
  filtered out when edited.

**Unsigned inbound provider webhook routes are not mounted.** SendGrid/SES
parser and support code may remain in the repository, but Owl Invites does not
expose those handlers as HTTP routes. Bounce/complaint ingestion through these
providers is unavailable until authenticated webhook support is implemented,
including signature, timestamp, replay, and message-correlation verification.
Operators must not wire or expose the dormant handlers manually; reverse-proxy
restrictions are not a substitute for provider authentication.

### 🔑 Operator note: rotate pre-v1.5.1 Postgres credentials

If you deployed `docker-compose.postgres.yml` **before v1.5.1**, rotate your Postgres password and confirm the Postgres port binds to `127.0.0.1` only. The old file shipped default `openrsvp:openrsvp` credentials and exposed the port on all interfaces; both were fixed in v1.5.1 (credentials now come from `.env`, port bound to localhost).

## 🧰 Tech Stack

## 📝 Changelog

### v1.8.1 (2026-07-26)

**Fixes:**
- Event-series endpoints classified errors the opposite way round to the v1.8.0 bug: `POST /series` reported *every* failure as `400 bad_request`, and the update/stop handlers fell through to the same branch. A database outage was therefore blamed on the caller — and since the handler echoed `err.Error()` verbatim, the raw driver text (`create event series: sql: database is closed`) was returned to the client. Genuine failures now log server-side and return a generic `500 internal_error`; validation still returns 400 with its message, via the same `errcode.ErrValidation` sentinel as the rest of the API

### v1.8.0 (2026-07-26)

**Fixes:**
- **Validation errors no longer return HTTP 500.** Handlers classified errors with hardcoded allowlists of message *prefixes*, so any message not on the list fell through to `500 internal_error` with an unactionable `ERR-XXXXXXXX` reference. In production this blocked real guests from RSVPing: a phone number the E.164 check rejected produced "an internal error occurred" instead of "invalid phone format" (67 occurrences across 18 distinct clients; one event saw 4 submission attempts and 0 successes). Classification now uses an `errcode.ErrValidation` sentinel matched with `errors.Is`, so new validation messages are covered automatically instead of failing open to 500
- The same defect is fixed in the event, comment, and CSV-import handlers. Event creation was the worst affected: the allowlist read `event_date is required` while the service raises `eventDate is required`, so that error — plus over-long title/description/location, invalid `contactRequirement`, `maxCapacity` bounds, an RSVP deadline after the event date, and unparseable dates — all reached organizers as 500s
- Phone numbers are normalized before validation, so `+32 479 12 34 56`, `+1 (415) 555-2671` and `+33.6.12.34.56.78` are accepted and stored as bare E.164. A national number with no country code is still rejected, now with an actionable message
- The invite form's phone placeholder was `+1 (555) 123-4567`, itself invalid under the server's E.164 check — the UI demonstrated a format the API rejects. Replaced with a valid example plus a country-code hint, and the field is normalized client-side

**Tests:**
- Deadline-enforcement fixtures used a hardcoded "future" date that had since passed, failing the suite regardless of code changes; they are now relative to `time.Now()`

### v1.7.0 (2026-06-10)

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL is now functional. A `?` → `$N` placeholder rewriter covers the stores and the transactional (`*sql.Tx`) paths, per-column boolean handling works with `lib/pq`, and a notification timestamp scan fix lands the last edge case
- Migrations split into per-dialect directories (`internal/database/migrations/sqlite`, `internal/database/migrations/postgres`) so CHECK-constraint changes use `ALTER CONSTRAINT` on Postgres
- CI runs the entire test suite against `postgres:16` alongside SQLite

**CI:**
- Re-gate `golangci-lint` and `govulncheck` as blocking. golangci-lint runs on the go1.26-built action (v2.12.2) without panicking, and govulncheck on go1.26.4 clears GO-2026-5037/5039
- Burned down ~176 pre-existing lint findings so the gate is genuine

### v1.6.0 (2026-06-10)

**Security:**
- Pin all GitHub Actions to commit SHAs; add least-privilege `permissions: contents: read` to `ci.yml`
- CSRF: authenticated requests now require a session-bound (HMAC) token, the token cookie is rebound at/after login, and the `/api/v1/auth/` CSRF exclusion is narrowed to the pre-auth magic-link/verify endpoints only, so `PATCH /auth/me` and `POST /auth/logout` are now CSRF-protected
- Webhooks: delivery URLs must be `https://` in production (`http://` allowed only in development)
- Web app: the session token no longer lives in `localStorage`; the SPA authenticates via the existing HttpOnly `session` cookie (Bearer is still accepted server-side for API/CLI clients). The magic-link token is stripped from browser history after use
- Repo hygiene: tooling directories moved into a tracked `.gitignore`, vendored e2e `node_modules` untracked, `.dockerignore` tightened

**Features:**
- Email open tracking remains available when enabled. Inbound SendGrid/SES delivery webhook parsers are retained but are not publicly mounted until provider signature, timestamp, replay, and message-correlation verification is implemented.
- Email unsubscribe and suppression list. Reminder and message emails carry an unsubscribe footer, a public token-based unsubscribe page lives at `/unsubscribe`, and suppressed addresses are skipped before sending. Migration 000030
- Account deletion and data export. Organizers can export all their data (`GET /api/v1/auth/me/export`) and permanently delete their account and all associated data (`DELETE /api/v1/auth/me`) from a new Account settings page (`/account`)
- Setup wizard. DB-backed non-secret instance settings (instance name, default timezone, allow-signups, support email) via `/setup`, stored in `instance_config` (migration 000031) and overlaid on the environment config at startup. Secrets remain environment-only
- Guest comment deletion. Guests can delete their own guestbook comments
- Guest feedback. A "Report a problem" widget on public RSVP pages lets guests submit feedback without logging in

**Tests & CI:**
- Large test-coverage increase (overall ~51% to ~61%): webhook dispatcher/HMAC/SSRF, the reminder pipeline plus its double-send lock, all email/SMS providers including SMTP header-injection defense, and an end-to-end server `httptest` suite
- CI gained coverage reporting, a `govulncheck` job, a `golangci-lint` job (plus `.golangci.yml`), and a Go 1.24/1.25 matrix

**Known limitations:**
- PostgreSQL support is experimental and not functional in this release. The stores use `?` SQL placeholders with no rewrite layer (and transactional paths use raw `*sql.Tx`), while `lib/pq` requires `$1, $2, …`, so queries fail under Postgres. SQLite is the supported and tested database; a Postgres compatibility fix is tracked as a follow-up

### v1.5.2 (2026-05-29)

**Dependency upgrades + CVE patches:**
- Bump `golang.org/x/net` v0.40.0 → v0.55.0 (fixes GO-2026-4918: net/http2 infinite loop on bad `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`) and `golang.org/x/sys` v0.33.0 → v0.45.0
- Add explicit `toolchain go1.26.3` directive to `go.mod` so local builds and CI (not just Docker) compile against the patched std-lib that fixes GO-2026-4980/4982 (html/template XSS escaper bypass), GO-2026-4977/4986 (net/mail quadratic concat), and GO-2026-4971 (net Dial NUL byte). `go` directive bumped 1.23.0 → 1.25.0 (required by upgraded modules)
- Upgrade all remaining Go modules to latest patch/minor: `aws-sdk-go-v2` suite, `go-chi/cors` v1.2.1 → v1.2.2, `golang-migrate/migrate/v4` v4.18.2 → v4.19.1, `lib/pq` v1.10.9 → v1.12.3, `mattn/go-sqlite3` v1.14.24 → v1.14.44, `rs/zerolog` v1.33.0 → v1.35.1, `smithy-go` v1.24.1 → v1.26.0
- Backend `govulncheck` clean: **0 vulnerabilities** (was 6 callable std-lib/x-net vulns)
- Frontend majors: `vite` 7 → 8, `typescript` 5 → 6, `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` 6 → 7; minors: `@sveltejs/kit` → 2.61.1, `svelte` → 5.55.10, `tailwindcss`/`@tailwindcss/vite` → 4.3.0, `@playwright/test` → 1.60.0, `svelte-check` → 4.4.8
- Add npm `overrides` pinning `cookie` ^0.7.2 (fixes GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x: out-of-bounds chars in cookie name/path/domain; SvelteKit still transitively pins `cookie@^0.6.0`). Frontend `npm audit` clean: **0 vulnerabilities**

**Security hardening:**
- Eliminate modulo bias in base62 token generation for RSVP guest tokens (`internal/rsvp/service.go`) and event share tokens (`internal/event/service.go`) — switch to rejection sampling so all 62 alphabet characters are uniformly distributed (previously the first 8 characters were ~25% more likely)

### v1.5.1

**CVE patches:**
- Bump `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5` v5.2.1 → v5.3.0 (fixes GO-2025-3770: Host header injection → open redirect in `RedirectSlashes`)
- Bump `golang.org/x/net` v0.33.0 → v0.40.0 (fixes GO-2025-3595: html.Tokenizer incorrect input neutralization called via bluemonday)
- Bump Dockerfile base image `golang:1.23-alpine` → `golang:1.26-alpine` to pick up patched std-lib (go1.26.3): html/template XSS escaper bypass (GO-2026-4980), net/mail quadratic concat (GO-2026-4977), net/http2 frame infinite loop (GO-2026-4918)
- Frontend: `npm audit fix` resolved 3 high / 2 moderate / 2 low CVEs in svelte, vite, @sveltejs/kit, devalue, picomatch
- Production `govulncheck` clean: **0 callable vulnerabilities** in the shipped binary
- Fix race condition in `TestExecuteCSVImport_SendInvitations` — switch shared slice to `atomic.Int32` so the asyncNotify goroutines cannot race with the test goroutine

**Security hardening (full audit pass):**
- Fix HTML injection in feedback email body — user-supplied `message` is now HTML-escaped before being embedded in the operator email (`internal/feedback/service.go`)
- Remove hardcoded Postgres credentials from `docker-compose.postgres.yml`; the file now requires `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` from `.env` and binds the Postgres port to `127.0.0.1` only
- Add global `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` — sets `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS only) on every response
- Defang CSV formula injection on export — cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, or CR are now prefixed with a single quote so opening the file in Excel/Sheets/Calc cannot execute attacker-supplied formulas (DDE, HYPERLINK exfil)
- Validate invite-card customization server-side — `primaryColor`/`secondaryColor` must match `#hex`, `font` is allowlisted, and `customData.backgroundImage` must be a `/`-relative path or http(s) URL with no CSS-breakout characters; client-side `InviteCardPreview` re-validates the URL as defense-in-depth
- Strengthen image-upload validation — every uploaded image is verified against its format-specific magic bytes (PNG signature, JPEG SOI+EOI markers, RIFF/WEBP), not just `http.DetectContentType`
- Align session cookie `MaxAge` with `cfg.SessionExpiry` so the browser cookie no longer outlives the server-side session
- Add `ReadHeaderTimeout` (5s) and `MaxHeaderBytes` (1MB) to the HTTP server to defeat slowloris
- Defensive CRLF stripping on SMTP `From` / `To` / `Subject` headers

### v1.5.0

**Design System Overhaul:**
- New warm rose (`#E54666`) brand palette replacing indigo, with stone (warm gray) neutrals
- Satoshi (display), Plus Jakarta Sans (body), and Geist Mono (data) fonts — self-hosted, no CDN dependency
- Semantic color tokens via Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` — change your brand in one file (`app.css`)

### v1.4.2

**Features:**
- Add instance admin dashboard with aggregate statistics — total events, guests, organizers, RSVP distribution, notification health, and feature adoption metrics
- Add `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var for instance admin role — comma-separated list of admin email addresses, synced on every page load (no re-login required to grant or revoke)
- Add `RequireAdmin` middleware — admin endpoints return 403 for non-admin users
- Privacy by design: all statistics are aggregate-only (COUNT, AVG, SUM) — no individual user data or PII is ever returned

**Backend:**
- New `internal/stats/` package with model, store, service (5-minute in-memory cache), and handler
- New database migration (000029): adds `is_admin` column to organizers table
- `GET /api/v1/admin/stats` endpoint with auth + admin middleware
- Admin status synced from `ADMIN_EMAILS` on session validation (not just login)

**Frontend:**
- New `/admin` dashboard page with metric cards, bar charts, notification health grid, and feature adoption breakdown
- Conditional "Admin" link in navbar (visible only to admins)
- Admin layout with auth + admin guard (redirects non-admins to /events)

### v1.4.1

**Performance:**
- Prerender landing page — full HTML delivered on first byte instead of blank SPA shell (19KB prerendered vs 1.2KB empty)
- Remove auth-blocking spinner from public pages — landing, invite, and RSVP pages render instantly without waiting for `/auth/me`
- Move auth loading gate to `/events` layout only, where it belongs
- Add gzip compression middleware (level 5) for HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, and SVG responses
- Add `Cache-Control` headers — `immutable` for Vite-hashed assets, `no-cache` for HTML to ensure safe updates
- Add inline critical CSS and fallback meta tags to `app.html` for faster first paint and SEO
- Enable SSR for prerenderable routes; separate SPA fallback (`200.html`) from prerendered `index.html`

### v1.4.0

**Features:**
- Add event guestbook/comments — authenticated attendees can post comments on public event pages with cursor-based pagination, rate limiting (5/hour), bluemonday sanitization, and organizer moderation
- Add webhooks/API events — organizers can register webhook endpoints per event, with HMAC-SHA256 payload signing, SSRF-safe delivery (private IP blocking, no redirects), exponential backoff retries, delivery history, test endpoints, and secret rotation
- Add CSV guest list import — upload CSV files with flexible column aliases (e.g. "full name" → name), preview with validation, duplicate detection, and optional invitation sending. Includes downloadable CSV template
- Add email delivery tracking — tracking pixel for open detection, delivery status progression (unknown → delivered → opened → clicked), bounce/complaint handling, and per-event email statistics dashboard
- Add comments_enabled toggle on events (enabled by default)
- Add import_source field on attendees to track CSV-imported guests

**Frontend:**
- Add guestbook section on public invite page with comment posting and pagination
- Add comments section on organizer event detail page with moderation (delete)
- Add CSV Import page with drag-and-drop upload, preview table, and step-by-step wizard
- Add Webhook management page with create/edit/delete, delivery history, test webhook, and secret rotation
- Add email delivery stats section on organizer event detail page

**Backend:**
- 5 new database migrations (000024–000028): notification tracking columns, event_comments table, comments_enabled column, webhooks + webhook_deliveries tables, attendee import_source column
- Webhook dispatch integrated into RSVP created, event published, and event cancelled callbacks
- Notification service extended with SendResult.MessageID capture for delivery tracking correlation

### v1.3.1

**Fix:**
- Fix timezone handling: event times now use the selected event timezone instead of the browser's local timezone for creation, editing, and display. Previously, entering 11:11 AM for a UTC-7 event from a UTC browser would store/display as 4:11 AM. Added `datetimeLocalToUTC` and `utcToDatetimeLocal` utilities; updated all event date formatting to pass the event timezone to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- Fix Go module path and all GitHub/GHCR references to use `github.com/yannkr/openrsvp`

**CI:**
- Skip CI workflow on tag pushes to avoid double Docker build with the Release workflow

### v1.3.0

**Features:**
- Add event series with recurring event support (daily, weekly, monthly frequencies)
- Add co-host management — invite other organizers to manage your event
- Add waitlist with automatic promotion when spots open up
- Add custom RSVP questions (text, select, checkbox types) with drag-and-drop reordering
- Add co-host email notification when added to an event
- Add event date to organizer RSVP notification email subject for recurring event disambiguation

**Security:**
- Add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `X-Frame-Options` headers on uploaded file serving
- Add email and phone format validation via `security.ValidateEmail` / `security.ValidatePhone`
- Add field length limits: name (200), email (254), phone (20), dietary notes (500), event title (200), description (5,000), location (500), message subject (200), message body (10,000)
- Add message rate limiting: 1 per minute for organizers, 1 per 5 minutes for attendees
- Fix RSVP concurrency: per-event mutex on `RemoveAttendee` and `UpdateAttendeeAsOrganizer` to prevent capacity over-subscription
- Add notification semaphore (cap 100) to bound concurrent notification goroutines
- Add error reference codes (ERR-XXXXXXXX) — 500 responses no longer leak internal error details; codes correlate with server logs
- Add co-host notification throttle (1 per hour per event:email pair) to prevent spam
- Add per-event mutex on co-host add to prevent TOCTOU race on count check
- Add 200ms timing floor on co-host add endpoint to prevent email enumeration via timing side channel
- Add per-IP rate limiter (10/min) on co-host add endpoint
- Make co-host limit configurable via `MAX_COHOSTS_PER_EVENT` env var (default 10)

### v1.2

- Security: `middleware.RealIP` is now conditional on `TRUSTED_PROXIES` — prevents clients from spoofing their IP via `X-Forwarded-For` to bypass rate limiting
- Security: CSRF tokens are now bound to the session cookie via HMAC-SHA256 — a token issued for one session cannot be replayed against another
- Security: CSRF cookie is no longer regenerated on every GET request (only set when absent)
- Security: RSVP lookup now sends a magic link email instead of returning the token directly (prevents email enumeration)
- Fix: dashboard stats (attending, maybe, declined, headcount) now refresh after editing or removing attendees
- Fix: max attendees validation rejects non-numeric input on both create and edit forms
- Fix: rate limiting scoped to API routes only (no longer affects static SPA assets)
- Add: rate limit handling (429) in frontend API client
